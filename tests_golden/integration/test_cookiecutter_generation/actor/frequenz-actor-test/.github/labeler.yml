# TODO(cookiecutter): Add different parts of the source
# For example:
#
# "part:module":
#   - changed-files:
#     - any-glob-to-any-file:
#       - "src/frequenz/actor/test/module/**"
#
# "part:other":
#   - changed-files:
#     - any-glob-to-any-file:
#       - "src/frequenz/actor/test/other/**"
#
# # For excluding some files (in this example, label "part:complicated"
# # everything inside src/ with a .py suffix, except for src/__init__.py)
# "part:complicated":
#   - all:
#     - changed-files:
#       - any-glob-to-any-file:
#         - "src/**/*.py"
#       - all-glob-to-all-file:
#         - "!src/__init__.py"
#
# Please have in mind that that the part:xxx labels need to
# be created in the GitHub repository.
