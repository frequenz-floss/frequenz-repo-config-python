"""Frequenz project setup tools and common configuration.

The tools are provided to configure 4 main types of repositories:

- APIs (api)
- Actors (actor)
- Applications (app)
- Libraries (lib)

# Common

## `nox`

### Writing the `noxfile.py`

Projects wanting to use `nox` to run lint checkers and other utilities can use
the [`frequenz.repo.config.nox`][] package.

When writing the `noxfile.py` you should import the `nox` module from this
package and use the [`frequenz.repo.config.nox.configure`][] function,
which will configure all nox sessions.

You should call `configure()` using one of the default configurations provided
in the [`frequenz.repo.config.nox.default`][] module. For example:

```python
from frequenz.repo.config import nox

nox.configure(nox.default.lib_config)
```

Again, make sure to pick the correct default configuration based on the type of
your project (`api_config`, `actor_config`, `app_config`, `lib_config`).

If you need to modify the configuration, you can copy one of the default
configurations by using the
[`copy()`][frequenz.repo.config.nox.config.Config.copy] method:

```python
from frequenz.repo.config import nox

config = nox.default.lib_config.copy()
config.opts.black.append("--diff")
nox.configure(config)
```

If you need further customization or to define new sessions, you can use the
following modules:

- [`frequenz.repo.config.nox.config`][]: Low-level utilities to configure nox
  sessions. It defines the `Config` and CommandsOptions` classes and the actual
  implementation of the `configure()` function. It also defines the `get()`
  function, which can be used to get the currently used configuration object.

- [`frequenz.repo.config.nox.session`][]: Predefined nox sessions. These are
  the sessions that are used by default.

- [`frequenz.repo.config.nox.util`][]: General purpose utility functions.

### `pyproject.toml` configuration

All sessions configured by this package expect the `pyproject.toml` file to
define specific *dev* dependencies that will be used by the different `nox`
sessions.

The following optional dependencies are used and must be defined:

- `dev-docstrings`: Dependencies to lint the documentation.

  At least these packages should be included:

  - `pydocstyle`: To check the docstrings' format.
  - `darglint`: To check the docstrings' content.

- `dev-formatting`: Dependencies to check the code's formatting.

  At least these packages should be included:

  - `black`: To check the code's formatting.
  - `isort`: To check the imports' formatting.

- `dev-mypy`: Dependencies to run `mypy` to check the code's type annotations.

  At least these packages should be included:

  - `mypy`: To check the code's type annotations.

- `dev-pylint`: Dependencies to run `pylint` to lint the code.

  At least these packages should be included:

  - `pylint`: To lint the code.

- `dev-pytest`: Dependencies to run the tests using `pytest`.

  At least these packages should be included:

  - `pytest`: To run the tests.

For some of these you should install too any other dependencies that are used
by the project. For example, if the project uses `pytest-asyncio`, you should
include it in the `dev-pytest` optional dependency.

It is also recommended, but not required, to provide a global `dev` optional
dependency that includes all the other optional dependencies, so users can
install all the dependencies needed while developing the project without having
to run `nox`, which might be a bit slow if you want to do quick iterations.

```console
$ pip install -e .[dev]
...
$ pytest
...
```

Here is a sample `pyproject.toml` file that defines all the optional
dependencies:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-package"
# ...

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev-docstrings = ["pydocstyle == 6.3.0", "darglint == 1.8.1"]
dev-formatting = ["black == 23.3.0", "isort == 5.12.0"]
dev-mypy = [
  "mypy == 1.1.1",
  # For checking tests
  "my-package[dev-pytest]",
]
dev-pylint = [
  "pylint == 2.17.1",
  "pylint-google-style-guide-imports-enforcing == 1.3.0",
  # For checking tests
  "my-package[dev-pytest]",
]
dev-pytest = [
  "pytest == 7.2.2",
  "pytest-asyncio == 0.21.0",
  "pytest-mock == 3.10.0",
]
dev = [
  "my-package[dev-docstrings,dev-formatting,dev-mypy,dev-nox,dev-pylint,dev-pytest]",
]
```

### Running `nox`

It is recommended to provide a `requirements-nox.txt` file that includes `nox`
and this package as dependencies. For example:

```
nox==2022.11.21
frequenz-repo-config==0.1.0
```

So users (and CI workflows) can easily install all the dependencies needed to
run `nox` like this:

```console
$ pip install -r requirements-nox.txt
...
$ nox
...
```

This will keep the current environment, installing only the dependencies needed
to run `nox` (which, in turn, will install the needed dependencies creating its
own virtual environment).

# APIs

## `setuptools` gRPC support

When configuring APIs it is assumed that they have a gRPC interface.

Normally Frequenz APIs use basic types from
[`google/api-common-protos`](https://github.com/googleapis/api-common-protos),
so you need to make sure the proper submodule is added to your project:

```sh
mkdir submodules
git submodule add https://github.com:googleapis/api-common-protos.git submodules/api-common-protos
git commit -m "Add Google api-common-protos submodule" submodules/api-common-protos
```

Then you need to create a `setup.py` file with the following content:

```py
import setuptools

from frequenz.repo.config.setuptools import grpc_tools

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setuptools.setup(cmdclass=grpc_tools.build_proto_cmdclass())
```

Then you need to add this package as a build dependency and a few extra
dependencies to your project, for example:

```toml
requires = [
  "setuptools >= 67.3.2, < 68",
  "setuptools_scm[toml] >= 7.1.0, < 8",
  "frequenz-repo-config[api] >= 0.1.0, < 0.2.0",
]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
dependencies = [
  "googleapis-common-protos == 1.56.2",
  "grpcio == 1.51.0",
]
```

Note the `api` extra in `frequenz-repo-config[api]`, this will ensure all
dependencies to build the protocol files will be installed when building the
package. Of course you need to replace the version numbers with the correct
ones too.

Finally you need to make sure to include the generated `*.pyi` files in the
source distribution, as well as the Google api-common-protos files, as it
is not handled automatically yet
([#13](https://github.com/frequenz-floss/frequenz-repo-config-python/issues/13)):

```
recursive-include py *.pyi
recursive-include submodules/api-common-protos/google *.proto
```

If you need to customize how the protobuf files are compiled, you can pass
a path to look for the protobuf files, a glob pattern to find the protobuf
files, and a list of paths to include when compiling the protobuf files. By
default `submodules/api-common-protos` is used as an include path, so if
yout configured the submodules in a different path, you need to pass the
correct path to the `include_paths` argument.
